# MATLAB-GPU-NVIDIA-Check
This files contain a module for checking the GPU resource depedency required before running Nvidia CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, and others using MATLAB. I'm also added another package that sometime required like Nvidia Nsight and Microsoft Visual Code C++, all of them already in the codes just run the module to begain checking and installing all required items.

I hope this module make things easier for utilized MATLAB using Nvidia CUDA
